/**
 *  NAME
 *      RefreshTagItemClones
 * 
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *      void RefreshTagItemClones(struct TagItem * clone, const struct TagItem * original)
 * 
 *  FUNCTION
 *      If (and only if) the Tag list 'clone' was created by calling
 *      CloneTagItems on the Tag list 'original', and the list original
 *      has NOT been changed in any way, then this function will change
 *      the list 'clone' back to its original state.
 *
 *  INPUTS
 *      original    - The source TagList (unaltered)
 *      clone       - The destination TagList (MUST be allocated by
 *                    CloneTagItems())
 *
 *  RESULT
 *      The second TagList now has the same values as the first.
 *
 *  NOTES
 *      If either of the inputs is NULL, then the function will not do
 *      anything.
 *
 *  EXAMPLE
 *      struct TagItem *orig, clone;
 *
 *      \* TagList orig has some values already *\
 *      clone = CloneTagList( orig );
 *
 *      \* In between here we do something to the TagItems in clone,
 *      but we need to have them restored.
 *      *\
 *
 *      RefreshTagItemClones( clone, orig );
 *
 *  BUGS
 *      None, however if either of the two pre-conditions is not fulfilled
 *      then this function will probably be unreliable, or trash memory.
 *
 *      We warned you...
 *
 *  SEE ALSO
 *      CloneTagItems()

 *  INTERNALS
