/**
 * NAME
 *      Insert
 * 
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      void Insert(struct List * list, struct Node * node, struct Node * pred)
 * 
 * FUNCTION
 *      Insert Node node after pred in list.
 *
 * INPUTS
 *      list - The list to insert the node into
 *      node - This node is to be inserted
 *      pred - Insert after this node. If this is NULL, node is inserted
 *             as the first node (same as AddHead()).
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *      struct List * list;
 *      struct Node * pred, * node;
 *
 *      // Insert Node node as second node in list
 *      pred = GetHead (list);
 *      Insert (list, node, pred);
 *
 * SEE ALSO
 *      AddHead(), AddTail(), Enqueue(), RemHead(), Remove(), RemTail(),
 *      "AROS: Exec Lists".
