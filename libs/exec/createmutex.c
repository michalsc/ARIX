/**
 *  NAME
 *      CreateMutex - Allocate and initialize a mutex
 * 
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *      struct Mutex * CreateMutex(int initialState);
 * 
 *  FUNCTION
 *      Allocates memory for the mutex and sets its initial state to given
 *      value. You *must* delete the mutex by calling DeleteMutex()!
 * 
 *  INPUTS
 *      initialState - Initial state of the mutex. It can be one ot two
 *              values, either MUTEX_LOCKED or MUTEX_FREE.
 * 
 *  RESULT
 *      Mutex - Initialized mutex which can be used to guarantee exclusive 
 *              access across several threads of the process.
 * 
 *  SEE ALSO
 *      DeleteMutex(), ObtainMutex(), ReleaseMutex(), AttemptMutex()
