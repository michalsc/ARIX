/**
 * NAME
 *      FindName
 * 
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      struct Node * FindName(struct List * list, CONST_STRPTR name)
 * 
 * FUNCTION
 *      Look for a node with a certain name in a list.
 *
 * INPUTS
 *      list - Search this list.
 *      name - This is the name to look for.
 *
 * RESULT
 *
 * NOTES
 *      The search is case-sensitive, so "Hello" will not find a node
 *      named "hello".
 *      The list must contain complete Nodes and no MinNodes.
 *
 *      When supplied with a NULL list argument, defaults to the exec port list.
 *
 * EXAMPLE
 *      struct List * list;
 *      struct Node * node;
 *
 *      // Look for a node with the name "Hello"
 *      node = FindName (list, "Hello");
 */

        }

    /*
        If we found a node, this will contain the pointer to it. If we
        didn't, this will be NULL (either because the list was
        empty or because we tried all nodes in the list)
