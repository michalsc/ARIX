/**
 *  NAME
 *      ObtainMutex - Obtain the mutex.
 * 
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *      int ObtainMutex(struct Mutex * mutex);
 * 
 *  FUNCTION
 *      Attempts to obtain the mutex. If the mutex was free and successfuly
 *      obtained by this function, TRUE is returned. Otherwise the function
 *      waits forever.
 * 
 *  INPUTS
 *      mutex - The allocated and initialized mutex to be locked.
 * 
 *  RESULT
 *      TRUE  - if the mutex is successfuly obtained,
 *      FALSE - in case of a problem with waiting.
 * 
 *  SEE ALSO
 *      CreateMutex(), DeleteMutex(), AttemptMutex(), ReleaseMutex()
