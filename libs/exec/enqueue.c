/**
 * NAME
 *      Enqueue
 * 
 * SYNOPSIS
 *      void Enqueue(struct List * list, struct Node * node)
 * 
 * FUNCTION
 *      Sort a node into a list. The sort-key is the field node->ln_Pri.
 *      The node will be inserted into the list before the first node
 *      with lower priority. This creates a FIFO queue for nodes with
 *      the same priority.
 * 
 * INPUTS
 *      list - Insert into this list. The list has to be in descending
 *             order in respect to the field ln_Pri of all nodes.
 *      node - This node is to be inserted. Note that this has to
 *             be a complete node and not a MinNode !
 * 
 * RESULT
 *      The new node will be inserted before nodes with lower
 *      priority.
 * 
 * NOTES
 *      The list has to be in descending order in respect to the field
 *      ln_Pri of all nodes.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE
 *      struct List * list;
 *      struct Node * node;
 * 
 *      node->ln_Pri = 5;
 * 
 *      // Sort the node at the correct place into the list
 *      Enqueue (list, node);
