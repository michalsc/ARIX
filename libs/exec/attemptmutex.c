 * 
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *      int AttemptMutex(struct Mutex * mutex);
 * 
 *  FUNCTION
 *      Attempts to obtain the mutex. If the mutex was free and successfuly

 * 
 *  INPUTS
 *      mutex - The allocated and initialized mutex to be locked.
 * 
 *  RESULT
 *      TRUE  - if the mutex is successfuly obtained,
 *      FALSE - otherwise
